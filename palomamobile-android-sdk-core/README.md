# Paloma Core SDK for Android
## Overview
The Core SDK module provides, as the name suggests, core functionality such as SDK initialization and SDK module management.
It also defines key framework classes and interfaces that define the pluggable SDK architecture.

The [javadoc is available here](http://palomamobile.github.io/paloma-android-sdk/docs/index.html) under package _com.palomamobile.android.sdk.core.*_

Before diving deeper into a specific SDK module we suggest you first have a look at the [Paloma SDK for Android overview]
 (https://github.com/PalomaMobile/paloma-android-sdk) to get an idea of:

* which services are supported
* how the SDK hangs together
* how to get an account so that you can start writing apps


## There are NO Dependencies on other SDK modules
